**//Project Pitches//**

Before you start working on your project, you’ll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:
  The basic story of your application
      Cyclists around the world look for sustainable and affordable modes of transportation during their travels
      Need to find locations with available bikes for use

  The core features of your MVP
      User can search bike stations by city (‘network’)
      Will showcase number of available bikes and empty slots
      Location (latitude/longitude) and name

  The API data you’ll be using and how you’ll use it
      https://api.citybik.es/v2/networks
  
  Challenges you expect to face
